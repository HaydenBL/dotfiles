# dotfiles
Files and things

Right now it just has bash settings but maybe it'll have other things eventually.

Right now I just keep a dotfiles folder in my home directory  (~/dotfiles) and then you can make symlinks for each of the files in your home directory
e.g. 'ln ~/dotfiles/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile'
