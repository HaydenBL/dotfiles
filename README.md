# dotfiles
Files and things

Right now it just has zsh settings but maybe it'll have other things eventually.

Right now I just keep a dotfiles folder in my home directory  (~/dotfiles) and then you can make symlinks for each of the files in your home directory  
e.g. `ln ~/dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc`
